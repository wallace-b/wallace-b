### Hi there! I'm Bradley Wallace! ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning deep learning, natural language processing and cloud technologies.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data analytics and machine learning applications & projects to assist with data-driven decision-making.

I am currently studying a Master's of Science in Computational Data Analytics at Georgia Institute of Technology (GeorgiaTech). Through my education and work experience, I have had, and continue to have, many opportunities to grow my knowledge and skills in the fields of Data Science, Software Engineering, Machine Learning Algorithms, Data Mining and Statistical Learning, Deep Learning, Algorithm and Data Structure Optimization, Data Warehousing, and Data Visualization.

After 10+ years working as a civil and transportation engineer, and 8+ years as a government engineer, I am furthering my development as a engineer by pivoting into software development and machine learning to pursue opportunities to completely change the way we live our lives for the better. I have future aspirations to work with machine learning applications in engineering, management or finance to help us all live a bit easier. I hope to one day merge these two career paths in autonomous vehicle and smart transportation infrastructure technologies. I am committed to lifelong learning and regularly fill my personal time with languages (written, spoken and coding haha), travel, wellness and brushing up on my mathematics (it's like a language!).

Be sure to check out my portfolio projects which highlight my ability to apply my data analytics and machine learning knowledge and skills to real-world datasets, such as banking customer information, property and real estate sales and automotive datasets. Also, be sure to check out my human-computer interaction projects in UI & UX design, needfinding, prototyping and evaluation, all with human subjects, sentiment analysis, feedback surveys and subject monitoring.

Please reach out to me if you would like to discuss any interesting opportunities we might be both aligned on!

I am also formerly a Certified Professional Engineer, CPEng (I've withdrawn from Engineers Australia whilst I am abroad).
